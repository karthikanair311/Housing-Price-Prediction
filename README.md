# House Price Prediction

We aim to develop and assess a model that is trained and tested on data from suburban Boston homes. After achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy, this model will be employed to estimate the market value of houses in the Boston area. Such a model could be extremely beneficial for real estate agents, providing them with valuable insights on a daily basis.
